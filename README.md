* **Unsupervised Segmentation :** Polarimetric SAR image segmentation is a difficult problem that requires a good understanding of the underlying physic and the elaboration of robust clustering algorithms involving Deep Learning Techniques. In this GitHub one may find intersting the approach implemented in order to determine a valid segmentation for the specific image of Bretigny. It involves physical decomposition of the raw data, filtering, extracting features and finally clustering it.
